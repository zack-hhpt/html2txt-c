# html2txt-c
convert a html file or stdin stream to txt file or stdout stream

It is necessary to convert HTML to TXT files. There are some problems when using both the built-in functions of the system and some C language implementations that I've found. This is a program written with the help of Copilot. It is relatively complete and can solve the problem of converting HTML to text quite well.  

需要将html转换为txt文件,系统自带和找到的一些C语言实现的使用时都有一些问题,这个是使用Copilot编程的一个程序,比较完善,能较好的解决html转换文本的问题
